# Coding challenges
The goal of this repository is to improve Java programming skills with a coding challenge.
The implementation of these challenges follows the methodology of Test-Driven Development, i.e.:

    - Think about tests cases
    - Write the tests
    - Implement the code
    - Test
    - Refactoring
    - Test again until all tests pass

The challenges are based on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) exercises.
